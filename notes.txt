TypeScript -> JavaScript with syntax for Types (JavaScript with Super Powers)

Steps:
Install node.js
See current Execution Policy -> It is 'restricted' by default
    'Get-ExecutionPolicy' 
Set the Execution Policy to 'RemoteSigned'
    'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser'
Install TypeScript globally in the system in terminal using
    'npm install -g typescript'
Install 'ts-node' in terminal using
    'npm install -g ts-node'
Initialize TypeScript Compiler in terminal to create 'tsconfig.json'
    'tsc --init'
Compile all .ts files to generate .js files
    'tsc'
Compile a particular .ts file to generate .js file
    'tsc filename.ts'
Run .js file (only .js file can be read by browser)
    'node filename.js'

Externel Extensions:
JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly
Code Runner
    Run the code just by pressing (Keyboard Shortcut to be set in settings of Code Runner)
        'Shift+Enter'
        

Changes in 'tsconfig.json' File

To retain ES6 features used in TS file to reflect in JS file (const, arrow function, etc.)
    change '"target": "es2016"' to '"target": "ES6"'

To Compile only selected files
    add '"files": ["sample.ts",sample2.ts]' at the end of the file

To Include all files from a folder while compiling
    add '"include": ["src/**/*"]' at the end of the file

To Include certain files from a folder while compiling
    add '"include": ["src/sample1.ts", "src/sample2.ts"]' at the end of the file

To Include all files during compilation
    add '"exclude": ["src/**/*"]' at the end of the file

To Exclude certain files during compilation
    add '"exclude": ["src/sample2.ts", "src/sample3.ts"]' at the end of the file

(Shows error if 'include' and 'exclude' paths conflict)

To Specify the destination of the .js files to be generated
    find '"outDir": "./"' in the file, uncomment it, change it to '"outDir": "./dist"'

To Use Axios and Express
'npm init -y' creates the 'package.json' file
'npm i axios' installs 'node_modules' folder and 'package-lock.json' file
'npm i express' installs 'node_modules' folder
